The NPS VMI Program is managed by the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Division and provides baseline vegetation information to the NPS Natural Resource Inventory and Monitoring Program. The U.S. Geological Survey Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NatureServe, NPS Gulf Coast Network, and NPS Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve (JELA) have completed vegetation classification and mapping of JELA for the NPS VMI Program.
Mappers, ecologists, and botanists collaborated to affirm vegetation types within the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) of JELA and to determine how best to map them by using aerial imagery. To map the vegetation and land cover of JELA, 26 map classes were developed. Of these 26 map classes, 24 represent natural (including ruderal) vegetation types, most of which types are recognized the USNVC. For the remaining 2 of the 26 map classes, one of the map classes represents a USNVC cultural subclass type for developed areas, and the other map class represents a non-USNVC type for nonvegetated open water. Features were interpreted from viewing digital aerial imagery using digital onscreen three-dimensional stereoscopic workflow systems in geographic information systems. (Digital aerial imagery was collected during July 25–26, 2014) The interpreted data were digitally and spatially referenced, thus making the spatial-database layers usable in a geographic information system. Polygon units were mapped to either a 0.5-hectare (ha) or 0.25-ha minimum mapping unit, depending on vegetation type.
This feature-class layer (vegetation-map polygon layer) provides locations of map-class information to 2,463 polygons covering 11,058.5 ha, with an average polygon size of 4.5 ha; the vegetation map contains the Barataria Preserve and the Fleming Plantation. This feature-class layer is supported with a series of relate tables providing classification to natural (including ruderal) and cultural vegetation types in the USNVC and to accuracy assessment (AA) results of map classes representing natural (including ruderal) vegetation types in the USNVC.</abstract><purpose>The JELA vegetation mapping project was initiated by the NPS VMI Program. The goals of the vegetation mapping project were to adequately classify, describe, and map vegetation types of JELA and provide resource managers, biological researchers, and the NPS Natural Resource Inventory and Monitoring Program with useful baseline vegetation information. This vegetation information is to support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning needs, providing a structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation communities and their relation to environmental processes across the landscape.</purpose><supplinf>This feature class is part of a larger work effort and complements other feature classes and relate tables within the project geodatabase.

A mapper would interpret a set of aerial imagery and then give the draft work to another mapper for QA/QC. The other mapper would assess the draft work for errors in mapping and return it for review and modification. Areas of high complexity could be revised more than once. This QA/QC process ensured that all portions of JELA were examined at least twice and by different individuals.
A thematic AA study was conducted of map classes representing USNVC natural (including ruderal) vegetation types. The AA field data were compared to the vegetation map data, followed by a review of the initial results and a reconciliation to the map data as necessary with agreement by NPS staff. Results from the AA study indicate an overal accuracy of 83.47% (kappa index of 82.54%) based on an analysis of data from 587 of the 594 AA sites. The results were tabulated into a contingency matrix. Most individual map-class themes exceed the NPS VMI Program standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval.</attraccr></attracc><logic>No formal logical accuracy tests were conducted.</logic><complete>All features identified by the image interpreters (mappers) were automated.

Although these steps proceeded sequentially, they overlap to some degree. Steps 1-4 occurred in 2015 and steps 5 occurred in 2016.</procdesc><procdate>20140401</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Preliminary Map Classification: Prior to field reconnaissance, mappers needed to become familiar with the vegetation types expected to exist in JELA. To accomplish this familiarity for the Park, the mappers met with vegetation classifiers, Park staff, and local experts and reviewed the vegetation classification and the field key to vegetation types that had been previously developed by NatureServe ecologists. During these meetings, each vegetation type was discussed. For each vegetation type, the discussion included what defines the type, where the type was known to exist within the Park, what other vegetation types are likely to be confused with the type, and any other aspects that could help define the type’s location or aerial imagery signature on the landscape. Using this information and personal experience, the mappers formed an initial map classification. This preliminary map classification promoted continuity from the classifiers to the mappers at the onset of the vegetation mapping process. Additionally, this preliminary step put in the hands of the mappers the foundations of a working map classification to test, update, and refine during field reconnaissance.</procdesc><procdate>20140401</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Field Reconnaissance: The purpose of field reconnaissance was to visit vegetation types in the field, discern their appearances in the aerial images, and establish mapping protocols. The mappers and classifier proceeded with field reconnaissance at JELA during 2015. The field efforts for mapping were completed during two trips in 2015. The first trip, in May, included the project orientation meeting. The second trip, in June, focused on the verification process, which tested a draft version of the vegetation field key and a sampling of preliminary map polygons. From the verification results, the map and vegetation field key were adjusted accordingly.</procdesc><procdate>20150501</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Map Classification: All map classes representing vegetation were linked to the vegetation types in either the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) or in NatureServe’s internal databases (for provisional and park-special types). For natural (including ruderal) vegetation, map classes were linked to natural types in the USNVC or NatureServe databases at the finest (lowest) level possible. For cultural vegetation, a map class was linked to a cultural type in the USNVC at the lowest applicable level. After a draft of the map classification was developed, a map-classification tree was created to facilitate the mapping process. A mapping tree is a diagram that divides the map classes into logical groups, and then further divides the groups into subgroups, with a final selection of choices between the similar map classes in each subgroup. The choices in a map-classification tree are meant to present the mappers with a limited and consistent set of options as they map and to remind the mappers of possible alternative map classes to consider. Throughout the project, the map classification remained fluid. Each field endeavor revealed new information that prompted modifications to the map classes and their definitions. Revisions were also made to the map classification as the vegetation classification matured. Furthermore, as aerial images were interpreted, new problems forced redefinition, expansion, conjunction, or minor adjustment to map-class definitions.</procdesc><procdate>20150501</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Aerial Image Interpretation and Mapping: The vegetation and land cover of JELA was mapped by staff at the USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center. Mappers interpreted vegetation and land cover types by viewing the digital aerial imagery collected for this project (imagery acquired in July of 2014). The mappers viewed the aerial imagery stereoscopically by using computer workstations equipped with both 3D and GIS software. These workstations incorporate passive stereo technology that allow mappers to view through polarized glasses a 3D image on a liquid-crystal-display monitor for a computer. Stereo models were imported into Stereo Analyst for ArcGIS (ERDAS, Inc.) for 3D viewing of the imagery and map layer editing. The mappers reviewed each others work for QA/QC. The mapping proceeded from fall 2015 to spring 2016. Map conventions based on field work and the vegetation classification helped maintain consistency in mapping. Standard image signature characteristics were applied including texture, color, pattern, and position in the landscape to guide placement of polygons during mapping. In addition to image signature characteristics, mappers needed to understand the environmental distribution of the vegetation types across the landscape to help them identify those vegetation types and properly place polygon boundaries. Many supplemental imagery and datasets were also used by the mappers to visualize and understand the landscape. The MMU conventions were applied to the polygon mapping. The map-classification tree was used to further assist the mapping process and enforce consistent application of the map classification. For each mapped polygon, the appropriate map class code was applied. The map layer was prepared for AA.</procdesc><procdate>20151001</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Database Development: At this stage, the spatial polygon layer (map) would have only map-attribute codes assigned to each polygon. To assign meaningful information to each polygon (e.g., map-class names and assignments to USNVC types), a feature-class table and a series of relate tables were produced. ArcGIS was used to relate the tables of polygon information within a geodatabase. This geodatabase also links the map to other feature-class layers produced by this vegetation mapping project, including vegetation plots, verification sites, AA sites, aerial image locations, aerial image flight line locations, and project boundary extent. Topology was created temporarily to check for spatial errors.</procdesc><procdate>20161001</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Vector</direct><ptvctinf><esriterm Name="fcl_jela_vegpoly"><efeatyp Sync="TRUE">Simple</efeatyp><efeageom code="4" Sync="TRUE"></efeageom><esritopo Sync="TRUE">FALSE</esritopo><efeacnt Sync="TRUE">0</efeacnt><spindex Sync="TRUE">FALSE</spindex><linrefer Sync="TRUE">FALSE</linrefer></esriterm></ptvctinf></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><planar><planci><plance>coordinate pair</plance><coordrep><absres>0.6096</absres><ordres>0.6096</ordres></coordrep><plandu>Meter</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>D_North_American_1983</horizdn><ellips>GRS_1980</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis><denflat>298.257222101</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><detailed Name="fcl_jela_vegpoly"><enttyp><enttypl>Attribute Table</enttypl><enttypd>Table containing attribute information associated with the data set.</enttypd><enttypds>Producer defined</enttypds><enttypt Sync="TRUE">Feature Class</enttypt><enttypc Sync="TRUE">0</enttypc></enttyp><attr><attrlabl Sync="TRUE">FID</attrlabl><attalias Sync="TRUE">FID</attalias><attrtype Sync="TRUE">OID</attrtype><attwidth Sync="TRUE">4</attwidth><atprecis Sync="TRUE">0</atprecis><attscale Sync="TRUE">0</attscale><attrdef Sync="TRUE">Internal feature number.</attrdef><attrdefs Sync="TRUE">Esri</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom Sync="TRUE">Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl Sync="TRUE">Shape</attrlabl><attalias Sync="TRUE">Shape</attalias><attrtype Sync="TRUE">Geometry</attrtype><attwidth Sync="TRUE">0</attwidth><atprecis Sync="TRUE">0</atprecis><attscale Sync="TRUE">0</attscale><attrdef Sync="TRUE">Feature geometry.</attrdef><attrdefs Sync="TRUE">Esri</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom Sync="TRUE">Coordinates defining the features.</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>MC_Code</attrlabl><attrdef>Map Class Code</attrdef><attrdefs>Producer defined</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Map-class code assigned to map polygon.
