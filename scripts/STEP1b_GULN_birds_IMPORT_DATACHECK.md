<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
Data issues identified on this page should be fixed in the original data files. The data check should then be RERUN with the UPDATED data files, until data issues are resolved to the extent possible--prior to running the EDA and data analysis scripts.
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:14px; color:blue; font-weight:bold;">
Note that the raw data have been modified/subset in the following ways for the data check (and, therefore, for analyses):
<br>
<br>
1. In all files, GUIS has been recoded to GUIS-FL or GUIS-MS.
<br>
<br>
2. These data only include actively surveyed locations, i.e., locations retained since the 2018 protocol peer review.
<br>
<br>
3. These data exclude bird observation records with NA for time bin, because these observations occurred outside of the survey time.
<br>
<br>
4. These data exclude bird observation records with distance bin of 'Flyover', because these are not relevant for analyses.
<br>
<br>
5. Column names have been modified to snake case (all lowercase with underscores between words) for coding management.
</span>
<br>
<br>
Only the first 10 records are shown for each table. Use the Previous/Next or page number buttons under each table to see additional records. Table records can be filtered, sorted, and exported. To export ALL records, select `Show 'All' entries` before clicking an export button.

# Missing survey events (since 2019)

* These active monitoring points have fewer than 2 surveys in a year (only checking point count data from 2019 to current year)

<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
Please update the Active Monitoring Points file (if the locations are not  active) or add the point count data for these survey events (if available), then re-import the updated active monitoring points and bird observation files.

# More than one record for a park unit-species code combination, in Park Species List

* The park species list has multiple records (with different information) for these combinations of park unit and 4-letter species code.*

<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
Please edit or delete incorrect records, then re-import the updated park species list. Each combination of park unit and species code should only have one record.
</span>


```
## No park unit-species code combinations are duplicated in the park species list
```

# Species codes that are missing from the Park Species List for a park unit

*These 4-letter species codes were detected in point counts for a park unit but are not recorded in the park species list for that park unit. In some cases the species may be in the park species list but the 4-letter species code may not match. *

<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
Please add the following species codes to the park species list for the corresponding park units. Then re-import the updated park species list. Only species and park units recorded in the park species list will be included in the final data set used in analyses.

# More than one record for a point location-survey date combination, in Site Conditions file

*The site conditions file has multiple records (with different information) for these combinations of point count location and survey date.*

<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
Please edit or delete incorrect records, then re-import the updated site conditions file. Each combination of point count location and survey date should only have one record.
</span>


```
## No location-date combinations are duplicated in the site conditions file
```

# Missing (important) information in Site Conditions file

*These site conditions records are missing important covariate information. The missing information are indicated by YELLOW highlighted cells in the table below.*

<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
If available, please add the missing covariate information to these records, then re-import the updated site conditions file. Otherwise--when covariate information is missing, the corresponding observations are excluded from analyses that include the covariate.

# Survey start time mismatch across files

*The survey start time for a site-survey differs between the Site Conditions file and the bird observation records.*

<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
For these site-surveys, please check the survey start time reported in the Site Conditions file vs the bird observation records. A time entry of NA may mean the file does not have a (site conditions or bird observation) entry for that site-survey. Compare and correct the time discrepancy, if possible. Otherwise, the corresponding observations will be excluded from analyses that include survey start time as a covariate in a considered model.

# Count records with unusual count entries

*These bird observation records have zero (0) or NA in the `count` column.*

<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
Please fix the `count` entry for the following bird observation records, then re-import the updated bird observations file.
</span>


```
## No unusual count entries
```

# Count records with missing (important) information

*These bird observation records have a missing value (NA) in at least one of these (important) columns: location_name, event_date, species_code, time_bin_id, distance_bin_id, count, data_status.*

<span style="font-size:14px; color:red; font-weight:bold;">
Please add the missing information in the following bird observation records, then re-import the updated bird observations file. Only bird observation records with complete (important) information will be included in the final data set used in analyses.
</span>


```
## No count record is missing important information
